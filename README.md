## React JS - Folder Structure

This React app simulates a file/folder structure where each folder can be expanded or collapsed. It allows users to **create, edit, and delete files and folders** dynamically, and the tree structure is visually represented.

### Features:
- **Interactive Folders:** Click on folders to expand or collapse their contents.
- **Dynamic File System:** Users can create, edit, and delete files or folders.
- **Indentation:** Subfolders are properly indented to represent their depth in the hierarchy.
